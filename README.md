Principal Component Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories

Program under development...

### TODO list:
- [X] Re-organize the program for easier maintainance
- [X] Read protein structure file
- [X] Read binary trajectory file
- [X] Apply proper algorithm to fit each frame to a reference (or average) structure 
- [ ] Build covariance matrix of Cartesian coordinates
- [ ] Matrix diagonalization
- [ ] Change coordinate data structure to avoid format conversion back and forth.
